                        <p class="card-text">In the 16th century, after the decline of the Vijayanagara empire and the Gajapatis, the coastal region of North Andhra, including Visakhapatnam, was annexed by the Jeypore Kingdom and remained part of it until the arrival of the British in 1711.[28] Evidently, the Maharaja of Jeypore was commonly referred to as the Maharaja of Visakhapatnam until the dissolution of the princely state in 1947.[29] European powers eventually established trade operations in the city, and by the end of the 18th century it had come under French colonial rule.[26][27] Control passed to the East India Company in 1804 and it remained under British colonial rule until Indian independence in 1947.</p>
